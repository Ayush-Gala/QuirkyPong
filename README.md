My very first game to get used to Lua programming and LOVE2D framework. Enjoy!

NOTE: This was one of my earliest games where I had no idea about conf.lua and GUI libraries. I had to code out every functionality of the game. If you decide to run the game then I recommend you download LOVE2D version 11.3 so that it runs smoothly. Just download a zip and extract it or clone the repository and drag-drop the folder onto the love.exe file.

Controls:
1. Press the 'enter' key to start the play.
2. The left paddle is moved using 'W' for moving up and 'S' for moving down and the right paddle is moved using the up and down arrow keys. 
3. Every 15 seconds the paddles length shortens and the speed of the ball increases.
4. Paddles are reset after every round.
